# Microsoft Video Studio Analysis

## Navigating this Repo

The Phase 1 Project Notebook.ipynbâ€‹ is the final notebook with markdown and code. The zippedData file contains the im.db and Box Office Mojo .csv file that I based my analysis off of. The Microsoft PDF is my powerpoint presenting my findings.


## Overview
[1]: [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/)
[2]: [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)

The project used exploratory data analysis of [IMDB][1] and [Box Office Mojo][2] data. The IMBD data included information on titles, directors, actors, and genres. The Box Office Mojo data included domestic gross revenue of movies. 

### Business Problem

Microsoft would like to create a movie studio. This analysis provides information on which movies, genres, directors, and actors have been highly profitable in the past 10 years. 

## Methods

The project used analysis of genres, directors, and actors with the highest domestic gross revenue to provide observation to Microsoft as to where their budget would be best invested.
